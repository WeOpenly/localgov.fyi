Now that your new <a href="https://www.dog-gonnit.com/tag/pet/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with pet">pet</a> is home with you, she’ll need to be licensed.</p><p>o Pet licensing requirements will vary by county &amp; state you live.</p><p>o Pet licensing fees often help compensate for <a href="https://www.dog-gonnit.com/tag/animal-welfare/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Animal Welfare">animal welfare</a> services!</p><p>o Licensing by the age of 4 months is encouraged!</p><p><strong>

What are the Mandatory Requirements for a Pet License?<br> </strong></p><p>These will vary according to your state, all US states, along with their territories, maintaining separate requirements. Most will require your pet to be licensed!</p><p>The following are the usual requirements to get your pet licensed:</p><p>o Proof of Current <a href="https://www.dog-gonnit.com/tag/rabies/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Rabies">Rabies</a> <a href="https://www.dog-gonnit.com/tag/vaccination/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Vaccination">Vaccination</a></p><p>o Vaccination paperwork, signed by your veterinarian</p><p>o Proof of Spay/Neuter will sometimes be required, often resulting in lower licensing fees.</p><p><strong>Rabies Vaccination:<br> </strong></p><p><a href="https://papergov.com/services/get-a-dog-license/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">Licensing a dog</span></a> in the United States requires proof of Rabies Vaccination, which you can get from your veterinarian. Rabies is still one of the deadliest, most feared viruses known to man, yet thankfully very seldom seen in the United States. We want to keep it this way!</p><p>Most US states will place significant rabies vaccinations regulations on domesticated animals (dogs, cats, ferrets). The frequency of vaccinations can vary depending on the state you live in.</p><p>o A <a href="https://www.dog-gonnit.com/tag/dog/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Dog">dog</a>/<a href="https://www.dog-gonnit.com/tag/cat/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with cat">cat</a> license is proof your pet has been vaccinated for Rabies!</p><p>o You’ll need a signed Rabies certificate from your veterinarian.</p><p>o Dogs must be at least three months old to become vaccinated against Rabies.</p><p><strong>Spay/Neuter:<br> </strong></p><p>Some US states or counties will require your pet to be spayed/neutered in order to become licensed. Extreme animal overpopulation in the United States is the main reason for this. Spaying or neutering will help limit the number of stray animals, homeless/shelter animals, and ultimately euthanized animals.</p><p><strong>Where to Get Your Pet License?<br> </strong></p><p>You can usually <a href="https://papergov.com/services/purchase-a-pet-license/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>apply/purchase a pet license online</strong></span></a> or straight from many veterinary clinics, county animal service shelters, or via mail with your county animal services department!</p><p><strong>Apply for a Pet License Online:<br> </strong></p><p>As soon as you type these words into a Google search, along with your state, you’ll be met with a wealth of resources! Because requirements will differ by state and county, there is no one place to register every pet in the United States. You’ll usually need:</p><p>o Completed &amp; signed Rabies vaccination certificate</p><p>o Updated contact information</p><p>o Method of fee payment (i.e. credit/debit card)</p><p>Example:</p><p><a href="https://papergov.com/services/renew-dog-license-maricopa-az" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">Apply for a Dog License with Maricopa County</span></a></p><p><strong>How long is my Pet License valid for?<br> </strong></p><p>In most cases, pet licenses are valid for one year from the date of issue &amp; need to be renewed annually. In some counties, you may have the option to apply for a longer term license (2-5 years).</p><p><strong>How to Renew Your Pet License?<br> </strong></p><p>This will vary by county, but you can almost always either mail-in or <a href="https://papergov.com/services/renew-pet-license/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">renew your pet license online</span></a>!
