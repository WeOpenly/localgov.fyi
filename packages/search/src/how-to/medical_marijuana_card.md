How to Get a Medical Marijuana Card

Starting the process of getting a medical marijuana card can seem overwhelming and confusing. Luckily, we’re here to demystify the process so you can experience the medical benefits of cannabis. 

Whether you’re looking to find a marijuana dispensary near you or are checking to see if you qualify, these 5 steps will help you quickly obtain your medical marijuana card.

1.	Find if You Qualify

33 U.S. states that offer legal medical marijuana cards, but each will have its different application systems. Even though each state will be different, you’ll still need to show proof that you reside in that state. You’ll need to have a qualifying reason for getting a medical marijuana card. The most common qualifying conditions are ADHD, HIV/AIDS, anorexia, arthritis, cachexia, cancer, chronic pain, seizures, glaucoma, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

2.	Find a Certified Doctor

Every state will dictate that you need a certified doctor to confirm that you have a qualifying reason for a medical marijuana card. They’ll write a recommendation based on your condition. You can search in your area for doctors that are certified. In some states, they can be osteopath, naturopath, or homeopath registered doctors. Check your state’s requirements for what doctor you can see.

3.	Submit an Application

After you have a doctor’s recommendation, you’ll fill out an application and submit it to the state. You can find the required forms on your state’s official MMJ website or [apply here online](https://papergov.com/services/apply-for-medical-marijuana-id-card/). When you go to your doctor’s visit, the physician’s assistant will usually be able to help you fill out the application as part of the consultation. You will be expected to pay a fee, although they can be waived if you qualify for other government assistance programs.

4.	Use Your Card

You can search your area for state-approved dispensaries that sell medical marijuana products, or if it’s legal to grow cannabis you can do that as well. You’d need a private location that allows cultivating marijuana for medical purposes. Each state’s card will have different purchase and possession limits, so research what your state allows.

5.	Renewing Your Card

Medical marijuana cards are valid for 12 months in most states. This is because authorities like to monitor your usage to make sure it is being used responsibly. They also want to make sure it is being used per your medical condition, so you’ll be required to go back to a certified doctor and send a renewal application to the state’s MMJ department. You’ll provide a government ID, medical records, and your original medical card.

Obtaining your medical marijuana card doesn’t have to be difficult. Check your state’s requirements and follow these directions to ensure a quick and easy application process.
